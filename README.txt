This is the final project I wrote for Purdue's CS334 class.  It's a basic 3D
graphics engine with portal mechanics like those in the videogame "Portal" by
Valve.

The included executable should only require installing
DirectX End-User Runtimes (June 2010) in order to run.  More info is included
in the README.txt inside the Executable directory.

Some demo videos can be found here:
